# uniCal ðŸ“†ðŸ“¦

Ever wanted to subscribe to an iCal calendar but only need specific events, such as a university schedule where you don't attend every course?  
**uniCal** is a Go application that downloads an iCal file from a given URL, filters out unwanted events using a blocklist, and creates a new, customized iCal file.

## Features

- Downloads iCal data from a specified URL.
- Filters events by titles listed in a `blocklist.yaml` file.
- Saves the filtered calendar to an `ical` directory.

## Configuration

Update `config/blocklist.yaml` with your iCal URL and the event titles to exclude. Example:

```yaml
origin_url: "https://example.com/calendar.ics"
blocklist:
  - "Event Title 0"
  - "Event Title 1"
```

The filtered calendar will be saved as `filtered_calendar.ics` in the `ical` directory. Use the Github raw URL of that file and add it to your calendar.
Use this URL and adjust it to your forked repo:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<gh-username>/uniCal/calendar-updates/filtered_calendar.ics`

## Keeping your Calendar Up-To-Date

The Github Action defined under `.github/workflows` refreshes and syncs with the upstream calendar. It can be run on schedule via a `Cron-Job`. Adjust this to your desired refresh-rate.
